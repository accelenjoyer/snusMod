This mod adds the following:
1- several types of snus, each has its own crafting and its own effects.
2-the "infected" entity.it is hostile to the player and, upon detecting him, begins to rise into the air, simultaneously shooting fireballs at him.
3-Two functional units-a generator and an Altar.
In the altar, you can combine all the snus to get the last one, which, when used, gives a special object-a scythe.
This scythe has 15 damage and throws up any mob it hits.The right mouse button summons two villagers, which may be useful.
The generator uses snus and converts it into energy, when 1000 energy is reached, click on the right mouse button to create a cube consisting of ores (ATTENTION:I could not fix the problem and for the generator to work correctly, right-click the mouse button not close to the block in order to avoid getting stuck in the ores.)
In general, this is my whole mod, I will be glad to hear feedback and comments
